A text file “install.txt” with step-by-step instructions for us to compile and run your
source code. Specify what operating system (include the version of that
operating system) is required and what dependencies you’ve used. You must
include specific instructions and terminal commands for the following:
a. How to install any dependencies your software requires.
b. How to compile your code with g++ (include the exact terminal command,
not an IDE configuration).
c. How to run your code, including a brief description of what should happen
when we run your code (e.g., should a GUI window open? will it spend
more than a few minutes processing data?)
Note that 4 points will be allocated towards whether/how easily we can follow
your instructions and see the same result, e.g., are any steps missing?

To run code:
1. In the POKEMON FINAL folder, in VSCODE type "g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++17 -g main.cpp -o main.exe" to compile the code
2. Type "./main.exe" to run the code

No operating system is required, and no extra dependencies were used. When the code is run, a prompt should pop up at the bottom asking 
for your name. The game will prompt you with choices as you go. Including what choices and restrictions you have. Some of these are
catching pokemon, buying items, and fighting the gym master. There will be an option to exit as long as you are not buying items, fighting,
or using items. 

To run the tests:
1. In the POKEMON FINAL folder, in VSCODE type "sh run_tests.sh" to run tests
2. If there are no differences the end-to-end tests pass
